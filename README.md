### **Methods**  

#### **LexBFS Ordering**  
This function computes the LexBFS ordering of nodes within a graph. LexBFS is a traversal algorithm that generates a specific node order using a lexicographic breadth-first approach. The resulting order has important applications in graph theory and optimization.  

#### **Chordality Check**  
A chordal graph is one in which every cycle of four or more vertices includes a chordâ€”an edge that connects two non-adjacent vertices in the cycle. This function determines whether a given graph is chordal.  

#### **Interval Graph Verification**  
An interval graph is a graph that can be represented by a set of intervals on a number line, where two intervals overlap if and only if their corresponding vertices share an edge. This function checks whether a given graph qualifies as an interval graph.
